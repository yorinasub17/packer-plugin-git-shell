# Git File

Type: `git-shell-file`

<!--
  Include a short description about the provisioner. This is a good place
  to call out what the provisioner does, and any additional text that might
  be helpful to a user. See https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/null
-->

The `git-shell-file` provisioner can be used to upload a file or folder from a git repository to machines built by Packer.
Like the `file` provisioner, the recommended usage of the provisioner is to use it to upload files, and then use the
[shell](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/shell) provisioner to move them to the proper place, set permissions,
etc.


<!-- Provisioner Configuration Fields -->

### Required

- `source` (string) - The git URL (e.g., https://github.com/yorinasub17/packer-git-shell-example.git) where the scripts
  are located.
- `ref` (string) - The [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) to checkout when sourcing
  the scripts.
- `file` (File) - The files from the git repository that should be uploaded to the machine. The `path` attribute is a
  relative path (relative to the git repo root) to the file or folder that should be uploaded to the given destination.

  HCL2 example:
  ```hcl
  provisioner "git-shell" {
    file {
      path        = "files/data"
      destination = "/opt/myapp/data"
    }

    file {
      path        = "files/configdir"
      destination = "/opt/myapp/config"
    }
  }
  ```





<!--

  should be listed under the optionals section. Defaults values should be
  noted in the description of the field

  the git repo. Defaults to `GIT_USERNAME`.
